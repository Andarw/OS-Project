# OS-Project

This project has significantly enhanced my skills in C programming, delving into various essential topics including file I/O, process management, string manipulation, and error handling. As I progressed through the project, I gained invaluable experience in navigating the intricacies of these concepts, solidifying my understanding and proficiency in C programming.

Moreover, the project provided me with an opportunity to delve into parallel programming, a crucial aspect of software development. By implementing pseudo-parallelism through processes, I learned how to leverage system resources efficiently, improving the performance of the program while gaining insights into parallel programming techniques.

In addition to technical skills, the project expanded my knowledge of file system manipulation, offering practical experience in working with files, directories, and symbolic links. This hands-on approach deepened my understanding of file system operations and directory traversal methods, essential for developing robust file-handling applications.

Furthermore, the challenges and issues encountered during the project underscored the importance of safe coding principles. From input validation to error handling, I realized that writing secure and reliable code goes beyond syntax knowledge. Embracing safe coding practices not only enhances the integrity of the program but also fosters a proactive approach to software development.

Overall, this project has been a transformative learning experience, equipping me with a diverse set of skills essential for software development. It reinforced the notion that programming is an active process, requiring continuous learning, problem-solving, and adaptation. As I continue to refine my skills and tackle new challenges, I am confident in my ability to develop robust, efficient, and secure software solutions.
